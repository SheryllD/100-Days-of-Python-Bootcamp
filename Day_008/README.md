# Project: Caesar Cipher with Function and Parameters 

# Steps & Todo's 

## Step 1: 

TODO-1: Create a function called `encrypt()` that takes`original_text` and `shift_amount` as 2 inputs.

TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the `original_text` forwards in the alphabet by the `shift_amount` and print the encrypted text.

#You can use the built-in Python `index()` function to find out the position of an item in a list. e.g.

TODO-3: Call the `encrypt()` function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.

TODO-4: What happens if you try to shift the letter 'z' forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?
